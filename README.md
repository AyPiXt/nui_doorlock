# qb-nui_doorlock
A conversion of nui_doorlock for QBCore. Thank you Linden for this amazing resource, unfortunately Linden has taken it off of their github so this repo now looks like it's a fork of another one but it was originally a fork of the original which was Linden's repo all credits are going to Berkie who converted the script to qb-core
